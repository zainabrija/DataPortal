## 🚀 **Step-by-Step Deployment**

### **Step 1: Prepare Your GitHub Repository**

First, ensure your code is on GitHub:

```bash
# If you haven't created a GitHub repo yet
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for Railway deployment"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```
